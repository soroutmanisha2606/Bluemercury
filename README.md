# Bluemercury Website Clone

Bluemercury Clone was a **Unit-4 Construct Week Project** at Masai School. In this project, we built a clone of the **Bluemercury e-commerce website**, focusing on replicating its clean design and core shopping functionalities.  

Bluemercury is a luxury beauty and skincare retail brand in the United States, offering high-quality cosmetics, skincare, and wellness products. Our goal was to create a responsive clone with a smooth shopping flow and essential features like product listing, filtering, cart management, and checkout simulation.
